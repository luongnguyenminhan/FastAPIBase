# Your rule content

- Follow SOLID principles and clean code practices.  
- Prioritize readability, maintainability, and performance in all code.  
- Use type hintS for Python functions.
- Use type hints when declare new variable in python or set a variable in python.  
- Use environment variables for sensitive configurations.  
- Log errors and exceptions properly; add logging to new code to make sure it run.  
- Follow project architecture; do not introduce unnecessary dependencies.  
- Ensure API endpoints have proper request validation and response models.  
- Maintain consistent naming conventions (snake_case for Python, camelCase for JavaScript).  
- Comment only when necessary; prefer self-explanatory code. 

- Follow the 3-layer architecture (Repository, Service, Controller).  
- Use Unit of Work (UoW) pattern for transaction management.  
- Keep business logic in the Service layer, not in Controllers or Repositories.  
- Repositories handle data access and should not contain business logic.  
- Controllers should be lightweight, only handling request validation and response formatting.  

- Must follow OOP, DRY rule do not create any standalone function in python.
- In API controller, write proper response and request model and model validation using pydantic model.

- always use interface before using class in python.
- in interface, always use abstractmethod decorator.
- in interface, always use @property decorator for getter and setter.
- in interface, always use @abstractmethod decorator for method.
- in interface do not need to use __init__ method and docstring.

-if code are repetitive, create a new common class and use it in all classes.
- if code are repetitive, create a new common function and use it in all functions.
- if code are repetitive, create a new common method and use it in all methods.

- make sure code are low coupled and high cohesive.
